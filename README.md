# OpacityOnTop

This is a handy productivity tool for Android developers and designers. 

If you are not sure about colors of your application UI elements, you can overlay your application activities, UI elements and the icon with any color and with opacity when designing your app. 

It can be useful for example to verify 

- what color goes well for button A that is next to button B. 

- To design Android themes, 

- and even choose the right color combinations for other Android visuals like notifications...
